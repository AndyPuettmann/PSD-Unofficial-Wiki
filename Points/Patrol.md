# Patrols
[return to index](/README.md) 

This section covers the patrols in Plasma Security Division.
 
# Your first patrol
Make sure to know the [abbreviations](/Abbreviations.md) as many of them will be used and you are expected to know them.

# Points
You earn between 0 and 1 points on a patrol.
You are not guaranteed to earn a point.
However, if you are active and patrol the plant (as and when instructed) you should be fine.
In case you do not get a point, it is always a good idea to contact the host and ask **politely** why you did not get points and how you could improve.
This will avoid further disappointments and make sure you dont miss points in the future.

# Time
A patrol can be between 20 and 60 minutes depending on the host.
On average its between 30 and 40 minutes.

# Places
The Patrol can be held in BHNPs or PURL.
Due to player distribution it is very unlikely to be on PURL.
Knowing the map and layout is required, as you are playing your regular security job inside the facility.
So make sure you know the map and facility guides.


# Activities
A patrol usually consists of only three stages

## Phase 1: Opening STS
Usually the discord announcement contains a place to gather and STS.

## Phase 2: Patrol
You keep the plant safe in this phase.
Host often starts at least one raid while the patrol happens.

## Phase 3: Closing STS
Watch the radio and team chat for the closing STS. You are ordered to a final meetup before you are being dismissed.

# FAQ

**Can I be rebel?**
Yes, if the host did not split you up in two groups with fixed roles, you are free to switch to the rebel-team.

**The server if full**
Yes that happens, patrols fill up quickly and offer only a very limited time to join.

**I have to leave in middle of the patrol**
That is usually no problem, make sure to inform the host before you leave.

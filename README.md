# DOs and DONTs

## Warnings and kills
You cannot just attack someone as you like.
You need to issue warnings before.

The chain of actions is usually like this:
* Misbehaviour 1 -> Warning 1 (Handbook says: Explain briefly why they get warned)
* Misbehaviour 2 -> Warning 2
* Misbehaviour 3 -> Warning 3 (Handbook says: Mention it is their final warning)
* Misbehaviour 4 -> Warning 4 (Kill the person, write the warning)
* Misbehaviour 5 -> Warning 5 (Kill the person, write the warning)
* Misbehaviour 6 -> Warning 6 (Kill the person, write the warning)
* Misbehaviour 7 -> Warning 7 (Kill the person, write the warning) -> At Warning 7+ you are allowed to call for a T2+ to issue a KOS on that person.

Exempt from this are:
* Mutants
* Players marked Kill-on-Sight (KOS)
* Armed rebels (BHNPs: Only during raids, PURL: Only if they attack you)

[return to index](/README.md) 

This section covers the Plasma Underground Research Laboratory, starting with a facility guide explaining how to operate the beam safely and the warning list showing example reasons for warnings that can be given here. 

# Facility guide
(coming soon)

# Warnings
Those are examples only, the handbook says:
Use common sense.
So everything that endangers the facility/personell/visitors can be warned.

(coming soon)

**DO NOT WARN** for the following reasons:
* Swearing
* Bypassing chatfilter
* Rude behaviour
* Annoying behaviour

This has to be reported to the council, to mute them in game or even ban them from the game completely.

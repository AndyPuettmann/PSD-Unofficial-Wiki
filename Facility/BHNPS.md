[return to index](/README.md) 

This section covers the Broken Hill Nuclear Power Station, starting with a facility guide explaining how to operate the plant safely and the warning list showing example reasons for warnings that can be given here. 

# Facility guide
(coming soon)

# Warnings
Those are examples only, the handbook says:
Use common sense.
So everything that endangers the facility/personell/visitors can be warned.

* Raising rods above 300°C
* Lowering rods below 200°C
* Turning off the 2nd and 1st coolant pump (3 pumps to 2 pumps is actually good)
* Turning off last feedwater pump (2 pumps to 1 pump is just lowering the cooling power, and may be okay depending on temperature)
* Enabling Fuel production
* Turning off waste processing
* Closing coolant refill valve (Technically only if coolant is below 100%... but yeah..)
* Closing valves at pressure above 1200PSI
* Opening valves at pressure below 800PSI
* Turning off emergency generator while both reactors are underpressure
* Taser abuse

**DO NOT WARN** for the following reasons:
* Swearing
* Bypassing chatfilter
* Rude behaviour
* Annoying behaviour

This has to be reported to the council, to mute them in game or even ban them from the game completely.
